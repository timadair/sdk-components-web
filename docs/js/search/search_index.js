It provides web component versions built \noff of the components found in @senzing/sdk-components-ng. The components themselves leverage the rest-api-client-ng package which itself is generated from the OAS specification.\nThe idea is to provide a framework agnostic option of those same components. \nWeb Components\nWeb components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.\nFor more information on the subject see the following sites:\n\nWebComponents.org\nWeb Components | MDN\nBuilding Components | Web Fundamentals | Google Developers\n\nInstallation\nnpm install @senzing/sdk-components-web --saveAdd the script tag to your html document like so:\n   ...\n    \n\n  \nAnd include the component tag in your document like so:\nScripting Components\nAll the components support all the same inputs and output as the @senzing/sdk-components-ng package. See documentation\nThe only major difference between the two packages is the dependency requirements and the way that eventing is handled outside of the components. The web components are accessible just like any other DOM elements.\nTo listen for the result of a the search box completed search for example you would add an \nevent listener to the dom node ie:\ndocument.querySelector('sz-search').addEventListener('resultsChange', function(evt) {\n  if(evt.detail){\n    var searchResults = evt.detail;\n    // check if results > 0\n    if(searchResults > 0){\n      console.log('SzAttributeSearchResult[]: ', searchResults);\n    }\n  }\n});To see a more complex example(a search box, with a results list, and a detail view) see the example.html file shipped with the npm package.\nStyling\nThere are some simple themes provided in the themes directory in the package itself. They can be included in the html document like so:\n...\n  \nCustomizing\nThere are some limitations when using web components. Because of the way that browsers treat the dom inside of the component tags themselves, the content inside a tag is not directly accesible. It means styling a sub element like so:\nsz-search-results sz-search-result-card { color: blue; }will NOT work. \nThe elements themselves were created with this limitation in mind and try to provide as many sensible CSS Variables as makes sense. For more information on CSS Variables See this article or here.\nan example acheiving the same effect as above that WILL WORK would be:\nbody { \n  --sz-search-results-color: blue;\n}Another option is to bake the styles in to the components themselves. This is the extreme option, but skips over the issue entirely. The requirements for doing so are the same as building the sdk-components-ng package from source. The repo is publicly avaiable, fork it and have yourself an afternoon. \nDependencies\nREST API Server\nThese components require the senzing Senzing REST API Sever to function. Follow the instructions to check out and build the Senzing REST API Sever from source or download a pre-built. \nExample Notes\nYou'll want to copy the example.html file to some place you can serve up with a webserver. By default the components are configured to access the REST API Server through a CORS request. To the best of my knowledge the components won't be able to send the appropriate Origin header when serving directly off of the file system. This is probably a good thing.\nBesides, it's a super easy problem to solve.\nnpm install http-server\n./node_modules/.bin/http-server node_modules/@senzing/sdk-components-web/example.html --cors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\n                             Apache License\n                       Version 2.0, January 2004\n                    http://www.apache.org/licenses/   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nDefinitions.\n\"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\nand distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\nthe copyright owner that is granting the License.\n\"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\nother entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common\ncontrol with that entity.
